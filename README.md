# 📊  Multiple Linear Regression Practice

## 📝 Project Overview
This project contains my practice on **Linear Regression**, one of the fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms. It includes **Multiple Linear Regression** (multiple features) implementations using Python and scikit-learn.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used is a sample dataset ("/kaggle/input/student-habits-vs-academic-performance/student_habits_performance.csv"). It contains numerical features used to predict a continuous target variable.

## 🔍 What’s Inside
- 🧹 Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- 🤖 Implementation of Multiple Linear Regression models  
- 📊 Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, etc.  
- 🎨 Visualizations of regression lines and residuals

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries
- 🐍 Python  
- 🐼 pandas, numpy  
- 📉 matplotlib, seaborn  
- 🤖 scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script  
3. Run the code cells step-by-step to follow the workflow from data loading to model evaluation

## 🔮 Future Work
- ✨ Try feature engineering to improve model performance  
- 📈 Experiment with polynomial regression or other regression algorithms  
- 🧪 Implement cross-validation for better model assessment
